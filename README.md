# Goal: Learn how to read code like a computer would process it.

I learned early on how to read my code and know how the computer would step through it. This is a critical skill. And it's fun to play with the debugger and watch your code in action.

As part of the Engineering Goals dojo, I'm going to have you battle a boss in order to level up. You're currently a white belt. If you want to earn the next belt, then you have to pass a mock job interview with Cats R' Us.

1. Check YouTube for "how to use the chrome debugger" and watch some tutorials
2. Inspect with Chrome, navigate to Sources -> playground.js
3. Put a breakpoint on line 1 by clicking in the gutter to the left of the code
4. Refresh the page so it will run the script again
5. Step through the code by clicking on "Step into the next function call"
6. Keep pressing this button
7. Pay attention to what line the script is currently on
8. Pay attention to the console output
9. Pay attention to the current value of 'cats', you can do this by looking on the right in 'Scope' or by hovering your mouse over the variable
10. Run through this whole script a bunch of times
11. Start trying to predict where the script execution is going to go next
12. Start trying to predict what is going to be output to the console
13. Repeat this until you understand what is happening
14. If you don't know what is happening, look for a tutorial on that topic

Let me know when you're ready to test. We'll do a mock interview. And the company will ask you to step through this line by line without using the debugger, just your beautiful brain.
